    <h1> Mark's Website</h1>
    <hr/>
    <h2> Bio</h2>
    <p>Hello, everyone my name is Mark. Welcome to my first website! 
        I'm from El Paso, TX. I've been in the Navy for 11 years working as an Operations Specialist.
        I'm an ASU graduate with a B.S. in Urban Planning. Although I love the idea of being a planner, 
        and I'm obsessed with beautiful, well planned cities like Singapore and Barcelona, I've decided 
        that I'd rather pivot into tech and learn how to code and develop. </p>

        <h2>Hobbies & Interests</h2>
        <p>I like to do many things, but my main hobbies are PC gaming and going to the gym. I play 
            <i>a lot</i> of <b><ins cite="https://playvalorant.com/en-us/">Valorant</b></ins>! (You'll probably see me there if you're on Discord.) But I
            also play other games like SSBU, LoZ, and CoD amongst others. I also <del>love</del> like 
            going to the gym and running. (So I gotta drink a lot of H<sub>2</sub>O.) Other things I'm 
            into is photography, art, movies and shows, comedy, UFC and bunch of other things. 
            I <i>do</i> touch grass.</p>

            <h3>In the (not too distant) future...</h3>
            <p>I hope this course helps me get to where I want to go with my life and help me find the 
                job I actually love to do and hopefully <sup>2</sup> my income.
            </p>
